## Turing Cafe - Reservation Portal

This application was built with `create-react-app`. After you clone down this repo, you will need to remove the current origin and create a new repo that you can push to on your GitHub account (you will need to add this new origin).

Once you have your own repository, you should run `npm install` and `npm start` to get up and running.

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays the current reservations for the Turing Cafe!

You will have 1 hour to build this application.
